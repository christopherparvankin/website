    Many people ask who is Chris, but they would be missing the point. I am not a man, and I am not an idea. 
    </div> 
    
    <div className="verse">
      I'm a 21st Century Anti-Anti Hero, I've been retrofitted, rebooted, & refurbished. I've undergone several surgeries to make me clobber-proof, though I'm not quite done yet.
    </div>

    <div className="verse">
    I’ve built super-computers out of Neptunian silica, I’ve played craps with almost every marine creature you can image, and my frontal lobe has a runtime that’s near constant. 
    </div>
    <div className="verse"> 
    I sleep in increments of 12 minutes, and I pay enormous sums of money to acquire exotic teas. 
    </div>
    <div className="verse">
    Please do not ask me to recite the constitution, unless its the parts that make sense. Batteries are immune against my natural magnetism, and I can read most minds.
    </div>

    <div className="verse">
      I used to own the color 'Burnt Umber', though I eventually gave this away for charity.
